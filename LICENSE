[a] License explanation
The copyright of this repository is a mess. This repository contains a lot of separate works with separate licenses. Following order explains how to find the license that applies to a work. The first rule that matches explains what license applies.

1. If a file contains an explicit license, that license applies to that file.

2. If a file is a third party program, binary or installer, the third party license applies.

3. All other files are licensed according to the "closest directory that contains a license". The closest directory is measured starting from the directory the file is in, going to the root of the repository. The first license you encounter is the license that applies to the file.

4. If no other license applies, the default license in [b] applies.
