# Overview

This Charm deploys the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org) with Spark integration.

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
