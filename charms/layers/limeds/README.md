# LimeDS

## What is it?

The LimeDS framework provides a visual toolset, allowing developers to rapidly wire together data-driven services in their programming language of choice. Built-in support for service reliability, scalability and caching makes it the ideal companion for developers aiming to speed up the creation of data-driven software.

## Why use it?

LimeDS allows developers to immediately focus on the use-case specific implementation. This is made possible thanks to a visual editor used for drawing dataflows, that will generate well-behaving modules following the micro services design pattern.
