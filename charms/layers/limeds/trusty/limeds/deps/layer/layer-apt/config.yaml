  install_sources:
    description: >
        List of extra apt sources, per charm-helpers standard
        format (a yaml list of strings encoded as a string). Each source
        may be either a line that can be added directly to
        sources.list(5), or in the form ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> for adding
        Personal Package Archives, or a distribution component to enable.

  install_keys:
    description: >
        List of signing keys for install_sources package sources, per
        charmhelpers standard format (a yaml list of strings encoded as
        a string). The keys should be the full ASCII armoured GPG public
        keys. While GPG key ids are also supported and looked up on a
        keyserver, operators should be aware that this mechanism is
        insecure. null can be used if a standard package signing key is
        used that will already be installed on the machine, and for PPA
        sources where the package signing key is securely retrieved from
        Launchpad.
