      URL from which to fetch resources (e.g., Hadoop binaries) instead of Launchpad.
  ganglia_metrics:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Enable metrics using Ganglia.  Note that enabling this option will
      have no effect if the service is not related to a ganglia service
      via the ganglia:master relation.  Enabling this option also will
      *not* restart the DataNode nor NodeManager components, so it will
      also be necessary to enable metrics on one or more of the hdfs-master
      or yarn-master services.  See the README for more information.
