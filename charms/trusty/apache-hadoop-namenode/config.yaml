options:
  resources_mirror:
    type: string
    default: ''
    description: |
      URL from which to fetch resources (e.g., Hadoop binaries) instead of Launchpad.
  ganglia_metrics:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Enable metrics using Ganglia.  Note that enabling this option will
      have no effect if the service is not related to a ganglia service
      via the ganglia:master relation.  Enabling this option also will
      *not* restart the DataNode nor NodeManager components, so it will
      also be necessary to enable metrics on one or more of the hdfs-master
      or yarn-master services.  See the README for more information.
  dfs_blocksize:
    type: int
    default: 134217728
    description: |
      The default block size for new files (default to 64MB). Increase
      this in larger deployments for better large data set performance.
  dfs_replication:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      Default block replication. The actual number of replications can be
      specified when the file is created. The default is used if
      replication is not specified at file creation time.
