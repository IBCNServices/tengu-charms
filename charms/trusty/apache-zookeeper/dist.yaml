ports:
    # Ports that need to be exposed, overridden, or manually specified.
    # Only expose ports serving a UI or external API (i.e., namenode and
    # resourcemanager).  Communication among units within the cluster does
    # not need ports to be explicitly opened.
    # If adding a new port here, you will need to update
    # charmhelpers.contrib.bigdata.handlers.apache or hooks/callbacks.py
    # to ensure that it is supported.
