options:
    dfs_blocksize:
        type: int
        default: 134217728
        description: |
            The default block size for new files (default to 64MB). Increase
            this in larger deployments for better large data set performance.
    dfs_replication:
        type: int
        default: 3
        description: |
            Default block replication. The actual number of replications can be
            specified when the file is created. The default is used if
            replication is not specified at file creation time.
    resources_mirror:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            URL from which to fetch resources (e.g., Hadoop binaries) instead of Launchpad.
    ganglia_metrics:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
          Enable metrics using Ganglia.  Note that enabling this option will
          have no effect if the service is not related to a ganglia service
          via the ganglia:master relation.  Enabling this option with the
          relation will issue a restart to the NameNode and all DataNode
          components on all related compute-slaves.
          See the README for more information.
