# This charm requires further work in these areas:

- validate and enable features/integration with other apache projects eg
oozie, spark-livy, pig
- investigate why oozie is always reported as a miss-configuration even if disabled
- clean up unused packages in lib/charms/hue.py
- desktop.secret_key configured as random string
- create a bundle or integrate hue in the appropriate bundles
