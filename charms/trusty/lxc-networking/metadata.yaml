description: |
  This Charm configures the unit so LXC containers are bridged directly to the given network, allowing them to dhcp the network the host is connected to for ip adresses.

  This is achieved by creating the lxcbr0 interface and configuring it to connect directly to the interface of the given network. Default LXC containers are connected to this bridge; connecting them to the eth0 interface.
