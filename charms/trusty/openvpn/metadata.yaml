description: |
  OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks over a single
  UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access remote sites, make secure
  point-to-point connections, enhance wireless security, etc.  OpenVPN
  uses all of the encryption, authentication, and certification features
  provided by the OpenSSL library (any cipher, key size, or HMAC
  digest).  OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic
  key exchange. It also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints (DHCP or
  dial-up clients), tunnels over NAT or connection-oriented stateful
  firewalls (such as Linux's iptables).
